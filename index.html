    <div id="bio-card">
        <p id="bio">I'm a second-year computer science major, originally from Boston, Massachusetts. Back in high
            school, I created a band that teaches students with disabilities how to play music. I helped teach 15
            disabled students musical instruments, which was one of the coolest, most fulfilling experiences in my
            life.<br><br>
            Then, over the past two years, I've worked as a software developer for a nonprofit called Tree-Plenish,
            which is an organization that works with schools across the country to host community tree-planting events.
            Specifically, I worked on the mobile app interface for volunteers and event hosts.
            <br><br>
            I've always loved using my passions to help others. Now, I'm looking forward to using my interest
            in
            engineering software to help out local nonprofits as much as possible, alongside the Bits of Good
            team.
